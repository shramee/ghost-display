Why're you looking here

Like I'm no face

Now I'm hearing all the things you never told me

Guess I'm no face

Chasing a lost place

I'm slipping hold me


Maybe you don't wanna know

All the little things that I wanna show

Oh so many words that I wanna say

for these feelings that would not wanna go


I'm just lying in my room

Wondering when this ceiling will doom

Only if I could get my anxiety cool

Stop overthinking everything I assume


Or maybe I can't really feel

See right through me this heart is made of steel

This pain and sane baby can't have a deal

All these tears maybe ain't nothing real


Why're you looking here

Like I'm no face

Now I'm hearing all the things you never told me

Look I'm no face

Chasing a lost place

I'm slipping hold me


I'm smoke, I'm cold,

Craving just to be the most me

Don't you dare, don't you dare

Don't you dare try to ghost me

Kinda blind like nothing you know

So numb like you don't know me


Don't you dare, Don't you dare

Don't you dare try to ghost me

Don't you dare, Don't you dare

Don't you dare try to ghost me


Woah yeah yeah

Woohoo yeah yeah

Ooh-ooo-ooo


Drizzling out your window,

About this storm in my home you won't know

All these demons in my head they won't go

And this halo on my head what a show


Every night feels a bit longer

As my thoughts just eat up my day

Thoughts of you keep growing stronger

As I keep fading away, fading away

I’m fading away

I’m fading away

I’m fading away


Why're you looking here

Like I'm no face

Now I'm hearing all the things you never told me

Look I'm no face

Chasing a lost place

I'm slipping hold me


I'm smoke, I'm cold,

Craving just to be the most me

Don't you dare, Don't you dare

Don't you dare try to ghost me

Kinda blind like nothing you know

So numb like you don't know me


Don't you dare, Don't you dare

Don't you dare try to ghost me

Don't you dare, Don't you dare

Don't you dare try to ghost me


Craving just be the most me

I'm stuck in a ghost race

just be the most me

I'm stuck in a ghost race

Don't look in my eyes like I'm no face

Don't look in my eyes like I'm no face

Don't look in my eyes like I'm no face

Don't look in my eyes like I'm no
